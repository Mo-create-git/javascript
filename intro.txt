History of javascript(js)
1995 -> Created by Brenden Eich at Netscape in just 10 days.

Originally called  Mocha, then Livescript, finally renamed javascript(even though it's not related to java).

Designed to add interactivity to web pages.

Standardized under ECMAScript (first standard in 1997).

Grew overtime form small scripts -> full web apps -> backend (Node.js) -> desktop & mobile apps

What is javascript?
